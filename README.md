Overview

Tetris is my favorite game and I would enjoy making my own version of it. I expect it to offer a valuable experience with javascript class interactions. The scope of game controls would include having different pieces rotate in either direction with help of arrow keys.

I would like to add some dynamics and colors to blocks to make the experience more interesting.

Functionality

Players will use left/right arrow keys to rotate blocks.
Game will have at least 2 levels of difficulty based on speed.
Blocks will have varying speed based on the level of difficulty they choose.
The game will end once player fails to avoid stacking blocks up to the top.
The score will be displayed on the side panel, updating in real time.
